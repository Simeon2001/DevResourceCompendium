## Introduction to SQL

### What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard programming language for managing and manipulating data in relational database management systems (RDBMS). It allows you to:
- Create and modify database structures
- Insert, update, and delete data
- Query data with complex conditions
- Define relationships between data tables

SQL was developed in the 1970s at IBM and has become the universal language for relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and SQLite.

## Basic SQL Concepts

### SQL Syntax Fundamentals
SQL commands generally follow this pattern:

```sql
COMMAND what_to_act_on
FROM where_to_find_it
WHERE specific_conditions;
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Marketing';
```

### Common SQL Data Types

| Data Type | Description | Example Values |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| INT | Whole numbers | 42, -7, 1000 |
| VARCHAR(n) | Variable-length strings with a maximum length | 'Hello', 'SQL', 'John Doe' |
| DECIMAL(p,s) | Precise decimal numbers (p digits with s after decimal) | 3.14, -99.99, 1234.56 |
| DATE | Calendar dates | '2023-10-01', '2025-03-31' |
| TIME | Time values | '14:30:00', '09:15:45' |
| BOOLEAN | True/False values | TRUE, FALSE, 1, 0 |
| TEXT | Long text strings | Article content, descriptions |
| BLOB | Binary data | Images, files, documents |

Different database systems may have variations in data type names and specifications.

## CRUD Operations

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete - the four basic operations performed on database records.

### CREATE (INSERT)

The `INSERT INTO` command adds new records to a database table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
-- Insert a single record
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3);

-- Insert multiple records
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES
(value1, value2),
(value3, value4),
(value5, value6);
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Add a new user
INSERT INTO users (username, email, created_at)
VALUES ('johndoe', 'john@example.com', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

-- Add multiple products
INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES
('Laptop', 999.99),
('Mouse', 24.99),
('Keyboard', 49.99);
```

**How it works:**
- The `INSERT INTO` command specifies the target table and columns
- The `VALUES` clause provides the data to insert
- You can omit column names if providing values for all columns in the correct order
- Use `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` and other functions to generate dynamic values

### READ (SELECT)

The `SELECT` command retrieves data from one or more tables.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC]
LIMIT number;
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Retrieve all columns for all customers
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- Get specific columns with filtering
SELECT first_name, last_name, email
FROM users
WHERE signup_date > '2023-01-01'
ORDER BY last_name ASC;

-- Column aliasing for better readability
SELECT 
    first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name,
    email AS contact_email
FROM users;
```

**How it works:**
- `SELECT` specifies which columns to retrieve (`*` means all columns)
- `FROM` identifies the source table(s)
- `WHERE` filters rows based on conditions
- `ORDER BY` sorts the results
- `LIMIT` restricts the number of rows returned
- Column aliases (`AS`) rename columns in the result set

### UPDATE

The `UPDATE` command modifies existing records in a table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Update a single column for one record
UPDATE users
SET status = 'inactive'
WHERE user_id = 42;

-- Update multiple columns
UPDATE products
SET price = price * 1.10,
    last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE category = 'Electronics';
```

**How it works:**
- `UPDATE` specifies the target table
- `SET` defines which columns to modify and their new values
- `WHERE` identifies which rows to update (omitting WHERE will update ALL rows!)
- You can update calculated values based on existing data

### DELETE

The `DELETE` command removes records from a table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Delete specific records
DELETE FROM logs 
WHERE created_at < '2023-01-01';

-- Delete all records matching a condition
DELETE FROM shopping_cart
WHERE user_id = 123 AND added_date < CURRENT_DATE - 30;
```

**How it works:**
- `DELETE FROM` specifies the target table
- `WHERE` identifies which rows to delete (omitting WHERE will delete ALL rows!)
- For removing all data from a table, `TRUNCATE TABLE` is often faster

## SQL Transactions

### What are Transactions?

A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. Either all operations complete successfully (commit), or none of them take effect (rollback).

### ACID Properties

Transactions follow the ACID properties:

- **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing
- **Consistency**: Database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other
- **Durability**: Committed changes survive system failures

### Transaction Control Commands

```sql
-- Start a transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION; -- or just BEGIN;

-- Create a savepoint
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;

-- Roll back to a savepoint
ROLLBACK TO savepoint_name;

-- Roll back the entire transaction
ROLLBACK;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```

**Example:**
```sql
BEGIN;
    -- Transfer $100 from account 1 to account 2
    UPDATE accounts 
    SET balance = balance - 100 
    WHERE id = 1;
    
    UPDATE accounts 
    SET balance = balance + 100 
    WHERE id = 2;
    
    -- Log the transaction
    INSERT INTO transaction_log (from_acc, to_acc, amount, date)
    VALUES (1, 2, 100, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
COMMIT;
```

**How it works:**
- `BEGIN` starts a transaction block
- Database operations are performed normally
- `COMMIT` finalizes all changes permanently
- `ROLLBACK` cancels all changes since the last `BEGIN`
- `SAVEPOINT` creates markers within a transaction for partial rollbacks

### Isolation Levels

```sql
-- Set isolation level (PostgreSQL example)
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

Common isolation levels (from least to most strict):
- **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Allows dirty reads
- **READ COMMITTED**: Prevents dirty reads
- **REPEATABLE READ**: Prevents non-repeatable reads 
- **SERIALIZABLE**: Highest isolation, prevents all concurrency issues

## Advanced SQL Commands

### JOINs

JOIN clauses combine records from two or more tables based on related columns.

**Types of JOINs:**

```sql
-- INNER JOIN: Only matching rows
SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;

-- LEFT JOIN: All from left table + matches from right
SELECT products.product_name, COALESCE(inventory.quantity, 0) AS stock
FROM products
LEFT JOIN inventory ON products.product_id = inventory.product_id;

-- RIGHT JOIN: All from right table + matches from left
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;

-- FULL JOIN: All records from both tables
SELECT students.name, courses.course_name
FROM students
FULL JOIN enrollments ON students.student_id = enrollments.student_id
FULL JOIN courses ON enrollments.course_id = courses.course_id;
```

**How JOINs work:**
- The join condition (`ON`) specifies which columns to match
- `INNER JOIN` returns only rows with matching values in both tables
- `LEFT JOIN` returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right
- `RIGHT JOIN` returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left
- `FULL JOIN` returns all rows when there's a match in either table

### Aggregation and GROUP BY

Aggregate functions perform calculations on sets of rows and return a single value.

```sql
-- Count total records
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees FROM employees;

-- Sum values
SELECT SUM(order_amount) AS total_sales FROM orders;

-- Group data and calculate aggregates
SELECT 
    department,
    COUNT(*) AS employee_count,
    AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
    MAX(salary) AS highest_salary,
    MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

-- Filter groups with HAVING
SELECT 
    category,
    COUNT(*) AS product_count,
    AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 AND AVG(price) < 100;
```

**How it works:**
- Common aggregate functions: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`
- `GROUP BY` organizes rows with the same values into groups
- `HAVING` filters groups (after aggregation), while `WHERE` filters rows (before aggregation)

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs create temporary result sets that can be referenced within a query.

```sql
WITH sales_cte AS (
    SELECT 
        product_id, 
        SUM(quantity) AS total_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY product_id
)
SELECT 
    products.product_name,
    sales_cte.total_sales
FROM products
JOIN sales_cte ON products.product_id = sales_cte.product_id
WHERE sales_cte.total_sales > 1000;
```

**Recursive CTEs** are especially useful for hierarchical data:

```sql
-- Employee hierarchy
WITH RECURSIVE org_chart AS (
    -- Base case (top-level managers)
    SELECT id, name, title, manager_id, 1 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case (subordinates)
    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.title, e.manager_id, oc.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN org_chart oc ON e.manager_id = oc.id
)
SELECT * FROM org_chart ORDER BY level, name;
```

**How CTEs work:**
- The `WITH` clause defines one or more temporary result sets
- Each CTE is like a temporary view accessible only within the current query
- CTEs can reference other CTEs defined earlier in the same WITH clause
- Recursive CTEs have a base case and a recursive case combined with `UNION ALL`

### Window Functions

Window functions perform calculations across sets of rows related to the current row.

```sql
-- Running total
SELECT 
    order_date,
    order_amount,
    SUM(order_amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total
FROM orders;

-- Partition by a column
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    department,
    salary,
    AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS dept_avg_salary,
    salary - AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS diff_from_avg
FROM employees;

-- Ranking functions
SELECT 
    product_name,
    category,
    price,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY price DESC) AS price_rank
FROM products;
```

**How window functions work:**
- The `OVER` clause defines a window of rows to operate on
- `PARTITION BY` divides rows into groups (similar to GROUP BY)
- `ORDER BY` within OVER sorts rows within each partition
- Common window functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `NTILE()`
- Unlike GROUP BY, window functions don't collapse rows

### UPSERT Operations

UPSERT (Update or Insert) adds a new record or updates it if it already exists.

**PostgreSQL syntax:**
```sql
INSERT INTO workers (worker_id, last_activity_ago)
VALUES ('worker123', '10 minutes')
ON CONFLICT (worker_id) DO UPDATE
SET last_activity_ago = EXCLUDED.last_activity_ago;
```

**MySQL syntax:**
```sql
INSERT INTO workers (worker_id, last_activity_ago)
VALUES ('worker123', '10 minutes')
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE 
    last_activity_ago = VALUES(last_activity_ago);
```

**SQL Server/Alternative syntax:**
```sql
BEGIN;
IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM workers WHERE worker_id = 'worker123') THEN
    UPDATE workers
    SET last_activity_ago = '10 minutes'
    WHERE worker_id = 'worker123';
ELSE
    INSERT INTO workers (worker_id, last_activity_ago)
    VALUES ('worker123', '10 minutes');
END IF;
COMMIT;
```

**How UPSERT works:**
- First attempts to insert a new record
- If a unique constraint violation occurs, updates the existing record instead
- Combines INSERT and UPDATE operations into a single atomic statement
- Implementation varies by database system

## Database-Specific Features

### PostgreSQL Features

```sql
-- JSON operations
SELECT 
    order_id,
    customer->>'name' AS customer_name,
    jsonb_array_elements(items)->>'product' AS product
FROM orders
WHERE customer->>'status' = 'active';

-- Full-text search
SELECT title, content
FROM articles
WHERE to_tsvector('english', content) @@ to_tsquery('sql & !basic');

-- Array operations
SELECT 
    product_id,
    product_name,
    unnest(tags) AS tag
FROM products
WHERE 'bestseller' = ANY(tags);
```

### MySQL Features

```sql
-- Generated columns
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    tax_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
    total_price DECIMAL(10,2) AS (price * (1 + tax_rate))
);

-- Group Concatenation
SELECT 
    department,
    GROUP_CONCAT(employee_name ORDER BY hire_date SEPARATOR ', ') AS employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

## Performance Optimization

### Indexing Strategies

Indexes improve query performance by providing quick lookup paths to data.

```sql
-- Basic index
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- Composite index (multiple columns)
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date 
ON orders (customer_id, order_date DESC);

-- Partial index (PostgreSQL)
CREATE INDEX idx_active_users 
ON users (email) WHERE is_active = TRUE;

-- Covering index (SQL Server)
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_covering 
ON employees (department) INCLUDE (salary, hire_date);
```

**How indexes work:**
- Indexes are data structures (typically B-trees) that store sorted copies of specific columns
- They provide quick access paths to rows
- Primary key columns are automatically indexed
- Composite indexes on (A,B) can help queries filtering on A or on both A and B
- Too many indexes can slow down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

### Query Analysis and Optimization

```sql
-- PostgreSQL explain plan
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT p.name, COUNT(o.id) AS order_count
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi ON p.id = oi.product_id
JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.id
GROUP BY p.name
HAVING COUNT(o.id) > 10;

-- MySQL profiling
SET profiling = 1;
-- Run your queries
SHOW PROFILE;
```

Query optimization tips:
- Select only needed columns (avoid `SELECT *`)
- Use appropriate indexes
- Limit result sets when possible
- Optimize JOIN conditions
- Consider query rewriting or restructuring

## Security Practices

### Prepared Statements

Prepared statements protect against SQL injection attacks.

```sql
-- Instead of string concatenation (vulnerable):
-- "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'"

-- Use prepared statements:
PREPARE user_query (text) AS
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1;

EXECUTE user_query('johndoe');
```

**How prepared statements work:**
- Query structure is defined separately from data values
- Parameters are sent to the database separately from the SQL text
- The database treats parameters as values, not as SQL code
- This prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL

### Row-Level Security (PostgreSQL)

```sql
-- Create policy limiting access
CREATE POLICY user_data_policy ON documents
    USING (owner_id = current_user_id());

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Data Masking (SQL Server)

```sql
-- Add dynamic data masking
ALTER TABLE customers
ALTER COLUMN credit_card ADD MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'partial(0,"XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-",4)');

-- Grant unmask permission
GRANT UNMASK TO finance_team;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Transactions for Multiple Operations**
   ```sql
   BEGIN;
   UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - 1 WHERE product_id = 101;
   INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES (1001, 101, 1);
   COMMIT;
   ```

2. **Normalize Data**
   - Avoid duplicate data across tables
   - Use foreign keys to establish relationships

3. **Use Constraints**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE orders
   ADD CONSTRAINT fk_customer
   FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
   ON DELETE CASCADE;
   ```

4. **Backup Regularly**
   ```bash
   # PostgreSQL example
   pg_dump -U username -h hostname dbname > backup.sql
   ```

5. **Monitor Long-Running Queries**
   ```sql
   -- PostgreSQL
   SELECT pid, query, now() - query_start AS duration
   FROM pg_stat_activity
   WHERE state = 'active';
   ```

6. **Optimize Queries**
   - Avoid `SELECT *` and specify only the columns you need
   - Use appropriate indexing
   - Consider query execution plans

7. **Use Appropriate Data Types**
   - Choose the most efficient data type for each column
   - Don't use VARCHAR(255) for everything

8. **Comment Your SQL**
   ```sql
   -- Calculate total revenue by region for Q1 2023
   SELECT 
       region,
       SUM(amount) AS total_revenue
   FROM sales
   WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31'
   GROUP BY region
   ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
   ```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. User Authentication

```sql
-- Store user with hashed password
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password_hash)
VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com', '$2a$12$...');

-- Check login credentials
SELECT user_id, username
FROM users
WHERE username = 'john_doe' AND password_hash = '$2a$12$...';
```

### 2. Order Management

```sql
BEGIN;
-- Create the order
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date, total_amount)
VALUES (1, CURRENT_DATE, 1000.00);

-- Get the new order ID
SET @order_id = LAST_INSERT_ID();

-- Add order items
INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity, price)
VALUES 
    (@order_id, 101, 2, 300.00),
    (@order_id, 205, 1, 400.00);

-- Update inventory
UPDATE products 
SET stock = stock - 2
WHERE product_id = 101;

UPDATE products 
SET stock = stock - 1
WHERE product_id = 205;

COMMIT;
```

### 3. Data Aggregation and Reporting

```sql
-- Sales by region and quarter
SELECT 
    region,
    EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM sale_date) AS quarter,
    SUM(amount) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers,
    SUM(amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS avg_sale_per_customer
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
GROUP BY region, EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM sale_date)
ORDER BY region, quarter;
```

### 4. Hierarchical Data

```sql
-- Employee hierarchy using a recursive CTE
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    -- Base case: top-level employees (no manager)
    SELECT 
        id,
        name,
        manager_id,
        0 AS level,
        CAST(name AS VARCHAR(1000)) AS path
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case: employees with managers
    SELECT 
        e.id,
        e.name,
        e.manager_id,
        eh.level + 1,
        CONCAT(eh.path, ' > ', e.name)
    FROM employees e
    JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
)
SELECT id, name, level, path
FROM employee_hierarchy
ORDER BY path;
```
